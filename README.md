## FAQ

### What Is This?

This is a small project I am working on in my spare time in order to speed up my calls and keep me on track during them at work. It's also to help me improve and keep my development skills current.

### Can I Add To This?

Definitely. If you would like to contribute in any way, even if it's just fixing a typo. Please clone the repository, make your changes and open a pull request. I try to be as active as I can on GitHub but life can sometimes get in the way so apologies if you're left waiting a while for a response I am not ignoring it, it's just life can get a bit hectic.
